# Maker final report analysis scripts
This repo contains the data and python script used to generate charts included in the final report on Maker's trial of SourceCred.

To generate the charts, simply run the included python file:
 `python maker_discord_metrics_analysis.py`
 
 Raw data output from Discourse can be found in `ForumMetrics.zip.txt`.
 
CSV files for individual metrics (what the script analyzes) were manually created from the above raw data.
